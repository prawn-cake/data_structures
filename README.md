Data structures
================
![PythonVersions](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ck0nc28ttga2pw9/python-2.7_3.4-blue.svg?dl=1)

This is a pet project implementing different common and specific data structures in pure python.

The goal of this project learn and understand how different data structures work under the hood.


## Usage notes

I don't recommend to use it in your production environment **as is**.

I recommend try to find mature implementations, but in case you need to customize behaviour and mature implementation doesn't allow you to do it or it just doesn't exist, 
my implementation is a good start to customize it for your needs.


## Data structure implementations

* Binary search tree
* Binary heap
* Graph (directed/undirected)
    * basic find path function
    * dijkstra search
    * bfs
 
* [BK-Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BK-tree)
* [Prefix tree] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie)


## Tests
